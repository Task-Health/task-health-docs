# Task Health Knowledge Base

This repo is the Task Health centralized knowledge base. It documents every aspect of the system — architecture, data models, domains, workflows, and integrations.

## HOW TO USE THIS REPO

1. Always start by reading `00-index/MASTER_INDEX.md`
2. Ask the user what they want to work on
3. Based on their answer, load ONLY the relevant docs listed in the MASTER_INDEX
4. Do not load everything — only what's needed for the current task

## HOW TO MAINTAIN THIS REPO

- Whenever you discover something new about the system during a work session, UPDATE the relevant doc here
- If a doc exceeds ~40 pages, split it into sub-docs and update MASTER_INDEX.md
- Always keep MASTER_INDEX.md current when adding or splitting docs
- Commit and push updates at the end of every session where you learned something new
